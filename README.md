# Fashion-AttGAN: Attribute-Aware Fashion Editing with Multi-Objective GAN
This repo provides the dataset used in our paper "Fashion-AttGAN: Attribute-Aware Fashion Editing with Multi-Objective GAN" (). 

## Dataset
The dataset contains 14,221 images and corresponding predicted attribute values. Currently we publish two attribute categories among others: clothing colors and sleeve lengths. 22 attribute values in total are selected in this published dataset. Therefore each image is associated with 1 color value and 1 sleeve-length value (these two values can be empty since there are other values of these two categories that are not covered in this dataset).


## Result
The results of our proposed Fashion-AttGAN and the original AttGAN are as follows:
